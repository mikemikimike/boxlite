// box whose state moved between the scan and the repair — and there the period
// it would close is a drifted one it was picked up to correct anyway.

// cpu/gpu/mem/disk are double precision on both sides, so a figure that has
// round-tripped through Postgres can differ from the box's by float noise.
// Without a tolerance the reconcile pass would rewrite an already-correct
// period on every run, fragmenting the ledger into unbillable slivers.
